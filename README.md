Who would win, X8 or Flat Octocopter ?

Octocopter have always been known as the ultimate in heavy lifters. As camera payloads get heavier and battery packs larger, the X8 is moving to the top of the food chain. We know it can be a bit confusing and thought that we would set the record straight by giving you the pros and cos of each so you would have all the information you need.

WHY NOT A QUAD ?

The reason why we look beyond four motors is to allow for redundancy. On a quad you need each and every motor to stay in the air. While motor and ESC failures are not common, having at least a hex allows most flight controllers to keep your rig in the air should if a failure take place. The redundancy also increases payload capacity from the extra thrust. While it is now possible to have four larger motors that equal the power of a hex with smaller motors, having peace of mind width an expensive camera is just too valuable to overlook.
